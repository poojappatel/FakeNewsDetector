## Overview

This Flask application enables text classification using a pre-trained BERT model. It classifies text as either "Fake" or "True" based on its content.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly and accessible tool for text classification, particularly for distinguishing between fake and true news articles or texts. Text classification is a valuable task in various domains, including journalism, content moderation, and social media analysis. By using a pre-trained BERT model, this application aims to:

- Assist users in quickly assessing the authenticity of textual content.
- Serve as a practical example of deploying machine learning models for real-world applications.
- Facilitate further research and development in natural language processing and text classification tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10.12
- Flask
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Other necessary libraries (refer to `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Acknowledgments: 
- This project uses the Hugging Face Transformers library for working with pre-trained BERT models.
